NBA-Height-Weight
=================
A quick python script to scrape players' heights and weights by season, which are output in CSV format.
I use BeautifulSoup and Requests to get the data from Basketball-Reference.com.
Keep in mind that it is a very slow process to get the data depending on internet connection.
This was quick project to get me aclimated with bs4 in python, as well as working with tuples and lambda expressions in python.
